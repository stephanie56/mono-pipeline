# Monorepo Pipeline POC

This repository provides an example of how an monorepo PR and release pipeline can be set up with one single pipeline.

This repository also demonstrates:

- use conditions and expression to control pipeline flow
- reuse templates/logics in a pipeline using github reusable workflow and composite actions.
